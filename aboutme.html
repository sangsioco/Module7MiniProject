        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am someone who enjoys hiking, photography, graphic arts, event planning, 
            and travelling. These activities fuel my creativity and passion for exploring 
            new horizons, both in nature and in the world of design. Whether capturing moments 
            through my camera lens, planning memorable events, or venturing to new destinations, 
            I find joy in discovering and sharing the beauty around us. Some of my work can be 
            found in the art gallery page</p>
